Greetings to all,

I'm trying to improve my developing skillset and I find myself trying out a lot of different things in order to achieve that goal.
I enjoy designing and writing code. I want to better understand how networks work and memorize the code that I write. I suppose one language at a time would be good, but I've worked with threedisciplines at once to build a website before and I think I can do it again.
